# xamarin-book-examples
These are the complete code examples for the Apress book by Dan Hermes entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xamarin-Mobile-Application-Development-Cross-Platform/dp/1484202155/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1428950597&sr=8-3&keywords=xamarin"><i>Xamarin Mobile Application Development</i></a>, an authoritative, four-hundred page journey through Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android, covering the entire breadth of the Xamarin platform!  These 200+ code examples are freely downloadable and include both C# and XAML.

Many thanks to Alex Blount (now a developer at Xamarin) and Xamarin MVP Jason Awbrey for their XAML contributions and to Xamarin MVP Ed Snider for his tech review of all of this code. 

<h2>What's In Here?</h2>

The book covers both Xamarin.Forms and platform-specific techniques using Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android so this code repository contains solutions for all three of those approaches in C# as well as their equivalent XAML. Chapter 2 starts with an intro example for just Xamarin.Forms, but Chapters 3-8 each contain <i>four</i> solution folders:
<ul>
<li>Xamarin.Forms C#</li>
<li>Xamarin.Forms XAML</li>
<li>Xamarin.Android</li>
<li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
</ul>
The first two solutions are for cross-platform Xamarin.Forms apps (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), and the second two solutions contain platform-specific code for Android and iOS only - in every chapter. In other words, whether you're coding Xamarin.Forms C#, Xamarin.Forms XAML, Xamarin.Android, or Xamarin.iOS: <i>it's all here</i>.

The book that goes with this code, <i>Xamarin Mobile Application Development</i>, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xamarin-Mobile-Application-Development-Cross-Platform/dp/1484202155/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1428950597&sr=8-3&keywords=xamarin">available at Amazon.com here</a>.

<h2>What Are These Chapters About?</h2>
Here is the chapter content: (no code examples in Chapter 1)<br/>

<b>Chapter 2 - Building Mobile User Interfaces (Xamarin.Forms Intro)</b><br/>
A Xamarin.Forms primer and a comparison of Xamarin.Forms vs. Platform-specific approaches such as Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. Covers Xamarin.Forms Pages, Layouts, and Views.

<b>Chapter 3 - UI Design Using Layouts</b><br/>
Layouts help us organize the positioning and formatting of controls, allowing us to structure and design the screens of our mobile app. 

<b>Chapter 4- User Interaction Using Controls  (Views)</b><br/>
Controls facilitate user interaction and data entry which is unique to the mobile user interface and differs substantially from the PC/mouse interface, largely due the use of gestures. 

<b>Chapter 5- Making a Scrollable List</b><br/>
Lists are one of the most powerful methods of data display and selection in mobile apps.

<b>Chapter 6- Navigation </b><br/>
Navigation lets a user traverse an app, move from screen to screen, and access features. Hierarchical navigation, modal screens, navigation drawers, alerts, drilldown lists, and other key patterns make up the core of mobile UI navigation.	State Management is the handling of data passed between screens as the user navigates through the app. 

<b>Chapter 7 - Data Access and  Data Binding</b><br/>
Data binding is consistent and cross-platform when using Xamarin.Forms. Modeled after data binding in WPF, the MVVM pattern is central to its implementation. In code we bind control fields to our data model and the binding mechanism is automatic. A manual implementation of a PropertyChanged event allows your code to stay in sync with the data source. The mobile data layer departs from the designs we are accustomed to in web apps and more closely resembles those found in desktop apps. 

<b>Chapter 8 - Custom Renderers</b><br/>
Custom Renderers allow us to go deeper than the out-of-the-box Xamarin.Forms views and take advantage of platform-specific UI feature sets while keeping a cross-platform approach.

<b>Chapter 9 – Cross-platform Architecture</b><br/>
How to architect a cross-platform application by managing platform-specific code. Project-level options in Xamarin including Portable Class Libraries(PCLs) and Shared Projects. Cross-platform coding techniques including conditional compilation, Dependency Injection(DI), and partial classes.
