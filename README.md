# xamarin-book-examples
These are the complete code examples for <i>Xamarin Mobile Application Development</i>, a book written by Dan Hermes and published by Apress that is an authoritative, four-hundred page journey through Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android, covering the entire breadth of the Xamarin platform!Â  These 200+ code examples are freely downloadable and include both C# and XAML. 

Chapter 2 contains an intro example for just Xamarin.Forms.

Chapters 3-8 folders each contain four solution folders:

Xamarin.Forms C# <br/>
Xamarin.Forms XAML  <br/>
Xamarin.Android  <br/>
Xamarin.iOS <br/>

The first two solutions in each chapter folder are for cross-platform Xamarin.Forms apps (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), and the second two solutions contain platform-specific code for Android and iOS only.

In other words, <i>it's all here</i>.

Many thanks to Alex Blount and Jason Awbrey for their XAML contributions!
